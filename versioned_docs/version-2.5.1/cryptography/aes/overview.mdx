## What is AES encryption

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that is commonly used to protect
sensitive data such as private keys, passwords, and other confidential information. AES encryption uses a secret key
and an initialization vector (IV) to encrypt and decrypt data, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized users
to access the original information. By using AES encryption, you can ensure that your sensitive data remains protected
from potential threats such as hackers or data breaches. This makes it an essential tool for securing sensitive data
such as private keys, which are often used to access valuable assets like cryptocurrency wallets.
