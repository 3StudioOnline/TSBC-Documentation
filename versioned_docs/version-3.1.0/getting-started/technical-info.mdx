## Blockchain

Currently Supporting Ethereum, and Polygon. 

We highly recommend the use of the Polygon main net network. Polygon as a network has a 
very high throughput of transactions per second, low environmental impact due to the proof of stake consensus mechanism, and extremely high security.

:::note 
To use custom blockchain you ned to know the blockchain's RPC endpoint link, chain ID, explorer and currency symbol.

## Features

All functions are exposed to blueprints, and you can use them directly in c++ such as:

* ECDSA, SECP-256-K1, a private and a public key generation based on elliptic curves.
* Keccak-256, sha-256, sha-512, ripemd-160 hashing function.
* Ethereum Address generation and validation.
* JSON RPC Request functionality to make JSON RPC call to any blockchain node that implements JSON RPC as a method of communication. 
* Async nodes and event call-back version.
* Basic ETH functions such as:
    - eth_gasPrice.
    - eth_getBalance.
    - eth_sendRawTransaction.
    - eth_estimateGas.
    - More coming in future updates.
* Uint256 parser.
* Hex conversion - Converters hex string to big int string, or other way around.
* Generate and sign a transactions to send via RPC calls.
* Base58 Parser.
* Secure Random Bytes Library.

:::info
To get the most out of this plugin a good knowledge in `Solidity` and `Ethereum` is required.

## IPFS

IPFS protocol is out of the `Blockchain` plugin's scope. 

To store data of an interactable NFT, you can store values inside a smart contract mapping.

We are currently working on a separate plugin that would allow for full IPFS implementation and even data parsing directly into text images or 
other commonly used forms of files.
