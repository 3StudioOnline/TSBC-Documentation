The returned *Response* <Step text="5"/> is a struct that holds the response data for the HTTP request sent to `ImmutableX`.

:::note
If *Success* is *True* it only means that there was no error on the data transport layer (HTTP).
You also need to check the response body to determine the actual outcome of the call.
