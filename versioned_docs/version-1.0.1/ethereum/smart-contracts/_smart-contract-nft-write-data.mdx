## Smart Contract Write Data & NFT minting

Minting an nft or calling a function to change data on blockchain is so called payable call function. Meaning you are posting it not via "Eth_call" 
but by "eth_SendRawTransaction". However it requires few extra steps in comparison to sending just normal funds.

1. Estimate Gas

In order for our transaction that is payable not to fail we need to know estimated gas price of the transaction. 
it is solely dependent on the DATA pushed with it. We can encode the function and its inputs in advance for use in all of those calls in a row. 
Now we know how much gas a call of this function will cost.

2. Sign Transaction

Now that we know the gas limit from estimate gas price, we can finish the signing of transaction. we input our private key of the caller, 
nonce (transaction count), gas price (from proper eth_ function), to address being the contract address, value being the payable value. 
Data  - as our encoded ABI values we created earlier. chain id from proper blockchain the token is on.
Important: the value for many call functions call be 0. but even so must be set to zero. All "write to contract" 
functions requires this procedure and payment of gas fees for execution, ,however some like minting functions -require 
additional fee on top of it - that ends up in the contracts balance.

3. Send Transaction

Now use "ETH send raw transaction" as described before with the transaction hash as signed transaction as input in sign transaction data.

If everything was followed correctly - you will get a transaction count and with next block (usually few seconds) the change in blockchain contract object will be visible.
