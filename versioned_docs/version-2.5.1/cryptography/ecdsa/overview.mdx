## What is ECDSA

ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a cryptographic algorithm used to generate digital signatures
for data integrity and authentication. It is based on the mathematics of elliptic curves over finite fields and is
widely used in various security protocols and applications, including blockchain technology, digital certificates,
and secure communications.

ECDSA offers several advantages, including shorter key lengths compared to traditional algorithms like RSA for equivalent
security, making it more efficient in terms of computational resources. This makes ECDSA particularly suitable for
resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems and mobile devices.

It's worth noting that ECDSA is widely used in blockchain technologies, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
and Ethereum, where it plays a crucial role in securing transactions and ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.
