The returned *Response* <Step text="3"/> is a struct that holds the JSON- info of the header and body of the response as well as https status code.

:::note
If *Success* is *True* that only means that the response from the *Blockchain* was successful only.

If successful, returns an integer value of the latest *Block Number* <Step text="4"/>.
