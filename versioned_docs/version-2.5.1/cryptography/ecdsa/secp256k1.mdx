## What is Secp256k1

`Secp256k1` refers to a specific elliptic curve and set of parameters used in the implementation of the Elliptic
Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The "SECP" stands for "Standards for Efficient Cryptography," and "256"
indicates the size of the key in bits. The "K1" denotes that this curve is specifically designed for use in cryptography.

The `Secp256k1` elliptic curve is defined over the finite field of prime order. The equation of the curve is: $y^2 = x^3 + 7 \mod p$.

where:
* $p$ is a large prime number (the field modulus),
* $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of a point on the curve.

`Secp256k1` has gained significant prominence due to its use in various blockchain networks, most notably in Bitcoin and Ethereum.
`Secp256k1` is used for key pair generation, digital signatures, and verification of transactions.
Addresses are derived from public keys generated using this elliptic curve.

The choice of `Secp256k1` for Ethereum was influenced by several factors, including the efficiency of the curve's
arithmetic operations, its resistance to certain types of cryptographic attacks, and its relatively simple mathematical
structure. The properties of `Secp256k1` make it well-suited for the cryptographic requirements of blockchain
applications, providing a good balance between security and computational efficiency.
