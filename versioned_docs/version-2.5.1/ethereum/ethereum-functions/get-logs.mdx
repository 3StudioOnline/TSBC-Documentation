The returned *Response* <Step text="5"/> is a struct that holds the JSON- info of the header and body of the response as well as https status code.

:::note
If *Success* is *True* that only means that the response from the *Blockchain* was successful only.

If *Logs Found* <Step text="6"/> is *True* that only means that the *Response* was successful and the *Logs Data* was found.

If successful, returns the *Log Objects* array <Step text="7"/> which contains the log objects.
