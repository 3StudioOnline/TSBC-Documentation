    * Chain ID <Step text="3"/> The chain id of the Blockchain.
    * Verifying Contract <Step text="4"/> The forwarder contract address (EIP-2771) that will verify the transaction.
* `Message` requires the following:
    * From <Step text="5"/> An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer.

    * Gas <Step text="8"/> The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.
    * Nonce <Step text="9"/> A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.
    * Deadline <Step text="10"/> A [unix timestamp](/docs/ethereum/meta-transactions/sign-meta-transaction#unix-timestamp) after which the request is not executable anymore.
    * Data <Step text="11"/> Encoded msg.data to send with the requested call.

## Unix Timestamp

`Unix Timestamp from Date Time` helper function that takes date time struct and converts it to a unix timestamp.

This helper function will make it easier for developers to specify a deadline for the meta transaction using unreal
engine date time struct.
